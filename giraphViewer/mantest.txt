Manual test plan for giraphViewer

1) Each button except for the clear button should toggle between green and red. Green if it is active.

2) If add vertex button is selected and you click on the canvas, you should see a new vertex appear.

3) If add edge is selected and you click on two different edges a new edge should appear.

4) If force direction is on, then the graph should automatically rearrange and center.

5) If force direction is off, then the graph should be draggable.

6) The clear button should empty the graph.

7) When adding a vertex and edge, a text box should appear that allows you to set the weight of the vertices and edges.

8) The algorithms dropdown should have a working kruskal algorithm which marks the edges in the MST as blue and red otherwise.
